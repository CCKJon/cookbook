add recipe list that gets all recipes in database

Create buttons to remove steps or make it so that if an ingredient or step is empty, remove it/disregard it
add modal for submitted recipe to state that a recipe was successfully added
fuse search to search for recipes

Create a sort function for recipe type (dessert, entree, appetizer, etc.)

Create login authentication so that only when logged in can a person update or delete a recipe.

Create a "favorites" list for logged in people - favorites page should have prompt to login if not already logged in.

login user page that displays a list of submitted recipes by user

by default, if there is no one logged in, then the UID used for the recipe creation is by default my own
